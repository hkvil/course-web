	<h1>Problem with less,greater,and and</h1>
	<p>
		The browser interpret the symbol as closing or opening of tag instead of the actual character,thats why u use another method to show the following symbol
		<ol>
			<li>&lt;</li>
			<li>&gt;</li>
			<li>&amp;</li>
		</ol>
		As you can see,we succed to print the symbol.
		Next i will print the symbol as it.
		<ol>
			<li><</li>
			<li>></li>
			<li>&</li>
		</ol>
		The symbol is still printed in this case,but when we check with w3c validator,it says"bad character,unescaped,try as 8lt;<br>
		Theres more of char reference other than shown,like:
		<ol>
			<li>Copyright &copy;</li>
			<li>Non&nbsp;breaking&nbsp;space</li>
		</ol>
		in the end reference used to print character that we doesnt have on keyboard.
